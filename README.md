# Zeotap_Assignment

This repository contains the implementation for the Zeotap Data Science Assignment, which involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and clustering.

## Files and Directories

### **Jupyter Notebooks**
- `Kajal_Sawant_EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis and insights generation.
- `Kajal_Sawant_Lookalike.ipynb`: Development of the Lookalike Model.
- `Kajal_Sawant_Clustering.ipynb`: Customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

### **Data Files**
- `Customers.csv`: Contains customer information (e.g., ID, name, region, signup date).
- `Products.csv`: Contains product details (e.g., ID, category, price).
- `Transactions.csv`: Contains transactional data (e.g., quantity, total value).

### **Reports**
- `Kajal_Sawant_EDA.pdf`: PDF report with insights from the EDA.
- `Kajal_Sawant_Lookalike.pdf`: Documentation for the Lookalike Model.
- `Kajal_Sawant_Clustering.pdf`: Summary of clustering results and metrics.

### **Results**
- `lookalike_results.csv`: Contains the top 3 lookalike recommendations for each of the first 20 customers.

## Tasks Implemented

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed detailed EDA to uncover trends, correlations, and insights.
- Generated a report summarizing actionable business insights.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- Built a model to recommend similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
- Results include similarity scores for the first 20 customers.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation
- Applied clustering techniques to segment customers based on their profile and transaction data.
- Evaluated clusters using metrics like the DB Index and visualized results.

## Instructions

1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure Python and required libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib) are installed.
   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a `requirements.txt` file is provided).

2. **Run Notebooks**:
   - Open and execute the Jupyter notebooks in the following order:
     1. `Kajal_Sawant_EDA.ipynb`
     2. `Kajal_Sawant_Lookalike.ipynb`
     3. `Kajal_Sawant_Clustering.ipynb`

3. **View Reports**:
   - Review PDF reports for a concise summary of each task's results.
